# Peer Code Feedback

<!-- Instructor note, try to pair up students of roughly similar skill level for giving feedback. -->

<!-- I like the idea of writing the code in a google doc or slack message, so that the reviewer can share the text of their feedback with their partner and the partner doesn't have to take notes. I'm thinking of maybe having a google doc template they can use.

But written actionable and kind feedback can be difficult, so I could also see an argument for only verbal feedback at first. What do you think? -->

<!-- I'm unsure about timing for this, because I think sometimes getting a new github repo up and running and also looking at totally new code can be quite difficult. Maybe each student can be in a breakout room while working on this and they can call the instructor over if they are having set-up difficulties? Another Idea I have is for students to exchange repos the day before so students have the option to spend more time on this if they want?-->

<!-- Sort of out there idea, I wonder if maybe we can have pods of four where students are working in pairs to give two sets of feedback this first time? Then they can break into pairs to share the feedback? Maybe 1 hour for giving feedback, 30 minutes per project. Then 15 minutes to share feedback. Then 5 minutes to reflect on the experience in a whole group discussion. -->
As with writing an essay, having an outside set of eyes give feedback can be very helpful for improving the quality of the end product. 
Additionally, reading other people's code is one of the best ways to level up as a developer!

For these reasons, code review is a key part of working on most development teams and something we will practice starting today.

You and your partner will exchange Github links for the repo and then independently walk through the sections below. You should answer the review questions from each section in a word doc or slack message so you can share the feedback with your partner.

After 30 minutes you'll move to a breakout room with your partner and take 10 minutes each to share the feedback from notes you’ve taken. 

*Remember that feedback should be actionable and kind.*

### Setup
First,
* Clone down your partner’s project
* Run your partner's project as a user would

Then, answer the following questions:

* Was your partner’s project easy to set up? Why or why not?
* Do they have a clear README? What sort of things could be included to make the README more clear?

### Usability

* How was your experience figuring out how to use your partner's project? 
* Do you have any suggestions for increasing usability?
* Did you find any bugs?

### Code Structure
Now move on to taking a look at your partner's code.

* Are there any areas of code that you found especially easy to understand? Or are there any things your partner did that helped you as someone trying to understand their code?
* Are there any other areas of code that you found more difficult to understand?

### Testing

* Do you have any feedback on the tests your partner wrote?
* Are there any other tests you think might be useful for your partner to add?

### Other

* Any other feedback or questions?
