## Week 3 Assessment

### Setup

In Github, fork [this repository](https://github.com/memcmahon/Mod1Week4Assessment).
<!-- I don't have permission to edit this repo, but it needs edits to match the scoring listed here with 8 points for the questions and 12 points for writing the tests -->

1. In your forked repository on GitHub, edit the `README.md` file - answer the BLANK questions before moving on to the exercise.  Make sure to SAVE your changes to the README before moving on!
2. In Visual Studio, clone your forked repository. In this solution, there is a `Vehicle` project and a `Vehicle.UnitTests` project.  The class in `Vehicle.cs` is complete, but the tests for that class are not yet finished.  Add tests to the `VehicleTests.cs` file so that all the methods and properties for the `Vehicle` class have tests.  When finished, there should fix the broken test and add a minimum of 2 more tests. (12 Points Possible)


### Submission

When completed, commit the progress you have made, and push your project to GitHub.  Instructors will be following up with some video feedback!

### Rubric

This assessment has a total of **20 Points**.  Earning **10 or more** points is a **pass** and will indicate that you are progressing well with the material.

** Instructor Note ** Students should fix one test, and add 2 more, for each of those three tests that they work on, 1 point is earned for the attempt, then 2-3 points based on the test itself.  4 points for a test that is accurately testing the method, downgrading from there.

As a reminder, this assessment is for students and instructors to determine if there are any areas that need additional reinforcement!

<!-- I like that you structured some of the short answer questions as "Imagine in an interview you were asked..." I think we should continue to reinforce this type of structuring of questions so students can more easily connect the work we do @ Turing to what they will be asked to do in the interview/job hunt/etc. -->

<!-- Similar to my feedback on the lab, I wonder if we make a question (or replace a question) that asks students to outline WHAT we need to test in the class itself. To me, a good outcome after week 1 of unit test instruction is a) I understand WHAT i need to be testing and b) I can sometimes write the code for testing the class itself ✅-->

<!-- If we replace a question, maybe we can combine questions 2 + 3 to be soemthing like "In an interview, you are asked - "What is automated testing and what is benefit of taking this approach?"  Ⓜ️: I'm not crazy about the two question combo in an interview.  I think in a written question, its ok... but I would rather keep them separate for now, and combine if we think it is absolutely necessary.-->
