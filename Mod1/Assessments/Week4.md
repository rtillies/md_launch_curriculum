## Week 3 Assessment

### Setup

In Github, fork [this repository](https://github.com/memcmahon/Mod1Week4Assessment).

1. In your forked repository on GitHub, edit the `README.md` file - answer the BLANK questions before moving on to the exercise.  Make sure to SAVE your changes to the README before moving on!
2. In Visual Studio, clone your forked repository. In this solution, there is a `Vehicle` project and a `Vehicle.UnitTests` project.  The class in `Vehicle.cs` is complete, but the tests for that class are not yet finished.  Add tests to the `VehicleTests.cs` file so that all the methods and properties for the `Vehicle` class have tests.  When finished, there should be a minimum of BLANK tests. (12 Points Possible)


### Submission

When completed, commit the progress you have made, and push your project to GitHub.  Instructors will be following up with some video feedback!

### Rubric

This assessment has a total of **20 Points**.  Earning **10 or more** points is a **pass** and will indicate that you are progressing well with the material.

** Instructor Note ** Students should fix one test, and add 2 more, for each of those three tests that they work on, 1 point is earned for the attempt, then 2-4 points based on the test itself.  4 points for a test that is accurately testing the method, downgrading from there.

As a reminder, this assessment is for students and instructors to determine if there are any areas that need additional reinforcement!
