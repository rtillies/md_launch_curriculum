- Set Chrome as your default browser: 
  - In your Chrome window, select the More menu by clicking on the three dots.
  - Select `Settings` from the list.
  - In the Default browser section on the left, click `Make default`.

### Install Slack

Slack is our main communication tool at Turing. **You will receive an invitation to join the Turing Workspace 2 weeks before your Mod 0 start date**. If you are not familiar with it, it may seem overwhelming at first. There are a lot of tips and tricks you'll pick up along the way.

**Action Steps:**
- [Download and install the Slack desktop application](https://slack.com/downloads/windows)

To ensure that you are prepared for your first session:
- Watch the [Slack Tutorial Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfq333EpWgM).
- Upload a clear and appropriate headshot for your profile image.
- [Set up your Slack profile](https://www.loom.com/share/6f10b796c90f40c09594899d71bf401a) to include your cohort, program, pronouns, and time zone.
- It's a good idea to get in the habit of checking Slack daily starting now.

### Create a GitHub Account

GitHub is a widely used platform that hosts code projects and allows for collaborative workflows. You will spend a lot of time on this site and become fluent in using it as a tool.

**Action Steps:**
- [Create an account on GitHub](https://github.com/). Please use your Turing email address.
- [Update your GitHub Profile](https://github.com/settings/profile) and be sure that you choose a username, status, profile info, and picture that are appropriate for a professional setting. GitHub is a platform where future/potential employers will be reviewing your work.

### Create a Replit Account

[Replit](https://replit.com/~) provides an online platform that allows us to write code and see the results almost immediately - all inside of one browser tab! There are many other similar (and awesome) tools available but replit is used regularly in Mods 1 and 2, so Mod 0 provides an introduction and some exposure.

Follow the steps below (if they are not necessary because you have already done them or have experience with replit, you can skip this):
- Create a free account using your Turing email address.
- [Bookmark this webpage on Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/188842?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop), so that you can easily find it again later.
- [Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnLE3bH6fHE) to learn how to navigate the interface and create new projects.

<br>

### Create a Trello Account

[Trello](https://trello.com/) is a Kanban-style project management tool we will use in Mod 0. It and other similar tools are used by most software developers to manage the tasks within a project.

- Please create a free account with Trello using your Turing email address.
- [Bookmark this webpage on Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/188842?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop), so that you can easily find it again later.
- Create a copy of your program's Mod 0 Trello board by following the steps below:
  1. Open the [Launch Mod 0 Trello Board]() to get started. *need link*
  1. In the upper right corner, select the `...Show menu` button.
  1. Select `... More` about halfway down the side menu.
  1. Select `Copy board` and create a name for your personalized Trello board. This board will now be saved on your personal Trello account.

<br>

### Create a Loom Account

[Loom](https://www.loom.com/) is a free online video tool that allows you to create instantly shareable videos. With Loom, you can record your camera, microphone, and desktop simultaneously. You will be required to submit videos throughout Mod 0 as part of the coursework. Although you can use other tools to accomplish the same goal, we strongly recommend using Loom as it is extremely user-friendly.

- Please create a free account with Loom using your Turing email address.
- [Bookmark this webpage on Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/188842?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop), so that you can easily find it again later.
- If you've never used Loom before, [watch this video](https://youtu.be/iugmJe8uDLE) to familiarize yourself with this tool.

### Install Zoom

Zoom is the primary tool for classroom time, study halls, and community building at Turing.

**Action Steps:**
- [Download and install Zoom](https://zoom.us/download/).
- If you haven't already, create an account with Zoom.
- [Update your name in your profile](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201363203-My-Profile) following this pattern: First Name, Last Initial, pronouns, Program - `Megan M (she/her), Launch`.
- [Learn how to raise your hand](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/205566129-Raise-Hand-In-Webinar).
- Give your Zoom account the following permissions: screen sharing, microphone, camera.
<!-- - Give your Zoom account screen sharing permission and microphone permission. -->

### Snap your Windows

Windows 11 offers a feature to position multiple windows on the screen. Known as Snap Windows, this feature lets you precisely control how and where a window is located by selecting a predefined layout. By snapping each window into a specific place on your desktop, you can more easily juggle multiple windows.

The best part is that there's nothing to install! [Learn more about Snap Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/snap-your-windows-885a9b1e-a983-a3b1-16cd-c531795e6241).

## That's all folks! 
To verify that all steps are completed and installations are working as expected, complete the steps below. If you do not get the expected output for any of the following steps, go back to that step in the computer setup and carefully follow all of the steps a second time. 
1. Quit out of all applications and close any extra windows. You can verify that only Terminal and Chrome are running by looking at your dock at the bottom of your screen. Applications that are currently running will have a little black dot under them. Then, open only **this** webpage and a **new Terminal window**.
1. **Rectangle:** Use `control + option + left arrow` to move this webpage to the left side of your screen and `control + option + I` to move your terminal to the upper right corner. Note: Your window cannot be in full-screen mode for rectangle to work. 
1. **Chrome:** In your Chrome window, open a new tab. At the very top under the address bar, you should see at least three bookmarked pages, [Replit](https://replit.com/~), [Trello](https://trello.com/), and [Loom](https://www.loom.com/looms/videos). 
1. **Slack:** Ensure that Slack is downloaded by opening up the Slack application using Spotlight. Hold down `command + space` to open up Spotlight and start typing `Slack`. Hit `return` and your Slack application should open in a new window. Quit Slack by holding down `command + q`.
1. **Zoom:** Ensure that Zoom is downloaded by holding down `command + space` to open up Spotlight and start typing `Zoom`. Hit `return` and your Zoom application should open in a new window. Quit Zoom by holding down `command + q`.
1. **XCode-select:** In your terminal, run `xcode-select -v`. If installed, your terminal will output the current version of xcode-select found in your system. For example, something like: `xcode-select version 2384.`.
1. **VS Code:** In your terminal, run `code .`. If installed correctly, your VS Code will open in a new window. Quit VS Code by holding down `command + q`.
1. **Homebrew:** In your terminal, run `brew doctor`. If installed correctly, your terminal will output `Your system is ready to brew.`.
1. **Git:** In your terminal, run `git config --list`. If set up correctly, you will see your current git configurations: 
```
credential.helper=osxkeychain
user.name "Eric Weissman"
user.email eric@example.com
init.defaultBranch main
core.editor "code --wait"
pull.rebase false
```
1. **GitHub:** To test that you configured your SSH key for GitHub correctly, run `ssh -T git@github.com` in your terminal. You should see something like this: 
```
Hi <your_username>! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```
1. **Rbenv:** In your terminal, run `ruby -v`. Your terminal will output the current version of ruby. It should look something like this: `ruby 2.7.2p137 (2020-10-01 revision 5445e04352) [arm64-darwin20]`.
1. **Node:** In your terminal, run `node -v`. Your terminal will output the current version of node. It should look something like this: `v16.15.1`.

If after re-reading and completing the setup steps a second time, you are still experiencing issues, document the problem with screenshots and reach out for support in your Mod 0 Slack channel!
