# How Humans Keep Track of Information and What That Means for Programming

Like yesterday, this is an introduction designed to get you looking at code, getting familiar with syntax, and starting to think like a developer.  The expectation is that you will NOT master any topics today!

### Humans categorize information and things
* dogs
* books
* food
* vocabulary
* important numbers

We know through experience that these things are all different kinds of objects, or different types of information.


### Humans rely on lists to organize related information
We use lists to help us accomplish related tasks (like grocery shopping; i could go to the store for eggs, come back for milk, come back for bread, or use a list to help me get everything I need at once.)

## Putting it all together

Review the code in [this repl](NEED A STARTER) On what lines do you find each of the concepts above?
