# How Humans make Decisions and What That Means for Programming

This is an introduction designed to get you looking at code, getting familiar with syntax, and starting to think like a developer.  The expectation is that you will NOT master any topics today!

## We make decisions by Observing, Analyzing Options, Acting
<some example>

## Computer Action
[Outputting Information](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_output.php) - Walk through each `Try it yourself`

## Computer Observations
[Variables](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_variables.php) & [Variables](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_variables_display.php)
[Input](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_user_input.php)
[Boolean](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_booleans.php)
[Comparisons](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_operators_comparison.php)

## Computer Analysis
[If Statements](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_conditions.php)
[Else](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_conditions_else.php)
[Else If](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_conditions_elseif.php)

## Putting it all together

Review the code in [this repl](NEED RICHARDS STARTER) On what lines do you find each of the concepts above?
