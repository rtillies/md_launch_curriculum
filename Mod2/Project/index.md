# Message Logger

## Learning Goals
- Demonstrate:
    * Version Control, including branches and pull requests.
    * Understanding of database table relationships.
    * Database CRUD with an ORM.

- Explore:
    * Using TDD to add additional features!


## Project Description
the aim of this project is to build on the Message Logger we created in Mod1.  Now, a user should be able exit the application, and return later to review past mesages.  This will require us to add a database to our Message Logger projects.

This project will give you the opportunity to showcase all of the concepts we have learned this Mod.  There might be skills that we covered all the way back in week 1, so don't forget to go back and review those earlier lessons and labs!

**Project Setup**
To get started on this project:

1. **fork and clone** this [starter repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/LaunchMod2Project)
    * The starter repo has code that will be similar to your Mod1 Project.
2. Run all tests to make sure the project is working (all tests should be passing).

When you have completed the Project Setup, send a link to your cloned repository to all your instructors.


### Iteration 1 - Creating and Conecting a Database


### Iteration 2 - User and Message CRUD


### Iteration 3 - Using LINQ to query the database


## Version Control Expectations
In order to demonstrate what you have learned about version control, you will be using commits, branches and pull requests during this project.

You must gather feedback from cohort-mates and/or instructors prior to merging any code into your `main` branch.

You must provide feedback on at least one other student's pull request!

## Project Presentation

You will present your project to other members of the cohort.  Keep presentations to 10 minutes. Since we are all working on the same application, we would like you to address the following questions/topics in your presentation:
