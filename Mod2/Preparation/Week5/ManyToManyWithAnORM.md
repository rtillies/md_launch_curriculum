## Pre-Work for [Many-To-Many With an ORM](/Mod2/Lessons/Week5/ManyToManyWithAnORM.md)

Tomorrow we are going to learn how to implement a many-to-many relationship using our ORM Entity Framework. To prepare for this lesson, you'll want to review many-to-many relationships.

Start by reviewing the Join Tables section of the [Data Relationships](/Mod2/Lessons/Week3/DataRelationships.md) lesson.

Then draw an entity relationship diagram (ERD) for the relationship between `pets` and `owners`. Make sure to include the join table!

Once you've drawn out your ERD, make sure to label the table names, primary keys, and foreign keys.
