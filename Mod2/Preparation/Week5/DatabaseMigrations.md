## Pre-Work for [Database Migrations](/Mod2/Lessons/Week5/DatabaseMigrations.md)

Read through the Microsoft documentation on Migrations: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/migrations/?tabs=dotnet-core-cli. You will notice the process feels very similar to what we talked about in the Intro to ORM lesson.

As you are reading, write your answers to the following questions. Be prepared to share your answers during the Database Migrations lesson:

1. How would you describe the process of evolving your model to add a new column?
1. What's one thing you learned about migrations from reading this documentation?
1. What's one question you currently have about migrations?
