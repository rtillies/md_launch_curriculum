## Pre-Work for [Data Relationships](/Mod2/Lessons/Week3/DataRelationships.md)

Tomorrow we are going to learn how to represent more complicated data relationships in our SQL databases. It's been a while since we've talked about databases! 

To prepare, review the [Intro to Databases](/Mod2/Lessons/Week1/IntroToDatabases.md) lesson. Write down questions that come up as you're reviewing the intro lesson so that you can ask them tomorrow.
