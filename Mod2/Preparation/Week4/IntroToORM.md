## Pre-Work for [Intro To ORM](/Mod2/Lessons/Week4/IntroToORM.md)

Tomorrow we are going to learn how to connect to a database from our console application. We're going to learn quite a few new vocab words. To prepare for tomorrow, review the database vocabulary we have learned so far. 

Reach out to your group or an instructor if you're stuck coming up with one of these definitions!

1. What is a database?
2. What is SQL?
3. What is PostgreSQL?
4. What is a database table?
5. What is a database row?
6. What is a database column?
7. What is a primary key?
8. What is a foreign key?


<!-- Any ideas for starting to think about ORM, EF, connecting to database type topics. All the videos and resources I'm finding are really in depth. -->
