## Lab Objectives
* Practice building a many-to-many relationship with an ORM

In today's lab, we're going to add to our library application and database. Before beginning make sure you have the library application open.

Today we are going to add a many-to-many relationship between books and authors, this time using Entity Framework to create that relationship for us.

<!-- Instructor note: If students have extra time because this goes quickly maybe encourage them to read more documentation that covers the core topics of EF we covered in class or build off of what we have covered. The introduction: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/ and entity properties: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/entity-properties?tabs=data-annotations%2Cwithout-nrt might be good places to start. -->
