## Week 1 Check for Understanding

* In your own words, what is git?  What is Github?
* Why do we use git and Github?
* Create a diagram that maps the branches and commits for the Git Practice project we created during the lesson.
* In your own words, what is a database?
* Imagine that you are creating a database of books.  How might you create a relationship between a book and its author?
* Imagine you are in an interview.  The interviewer asks: How would you describe CRUD? (make sure to use examples!)
* Why do we need to use a `WHERE` when deleting or updating records?
* List each CRUD action and its corresponding SQL command(s).
