# SQL CRUD

## Learning Goals
- Define CRUD
- Use SQL to SELECT, INSERT, REMOVE and UPDATE records
- Use basic WHERE clause to filter records

## Warmup

Spend about 10 minutes googling `CRUD` (all caps) as it relates to programming, databases, and SQL.
* What does each letter stand for?
* In your own words, what does each action do?

Be ready to share your findings!

**For this lesson, all SQL examples will be based on our Orders and Customers tables that we created in the [Intro to Databases Lesson](/Mod2/Lessons/Week1/IntroToDatabases.md)!**

## Inserting Data in our Tables

In SQL, we **create** records using the `INSERT INTO` command.  `INSERT INTO` can add one or multiple records.

## Check for Understanding
* Imagine you are in an interview.  The interviewer asks: How would you describe CRUD? (make sure to use examples!)
