# Art of the Graceful Exit

## Learning Goals
* Strategies for responding questions you can't answer.
* Identify personal qualities you want to highlight.

## Warm Up
Imagine an interview where you are are asked a question you do not know the answer to.  
* How do you feel? 
* How do you answer?  
* What impression does the interviewer have of you based on your answer?

## Purpose of an Interview
What is the job of an interviewer?

Of course they are asking you some knowledge-based questions to see what you know and what you donâ€™t know, but more importantly, they are trying to figure out what it would be like working with you.

What type of person are you? What are you like working with teams? How much direction, supervision, and assistance will you need?

When answering interview questions, you are providing the interviewer with lots of insight and information about the personal qualities you will bring to their team.
