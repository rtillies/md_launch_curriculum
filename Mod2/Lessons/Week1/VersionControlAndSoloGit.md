# Version Control with Git/Github

## Learning Goals
- Define Version Control and its benefit
- Build a mental model of branching workflow
- Practice committing and branching on a solo repository

## Warm Up
In a notebook, reflect on the following:
* When doing something like writing an essay, or research paper, how have you saved your work?
* For school projects, what tools have you used to collaborate on a presentation or paper?
* What do you already know about git and GitHub?

### Why Git?
When we work on long projects (something that takes more than a few hours - writing a book, tracking a budget, or coding an application), we need to often:
* save progress
* edit old work
* share our work with others

You may be familiar with doing all of these things with tools like Google Docs, Excel, or Word.  All of these programs allow you to save, edit and share work.  But, they each can only manage their own files - with one command you can only save or share one at a time.

Today, we are going to introduce a new tool for managing how we save, edit, and share our work.

Let's say you have a project on your computer that has the following file structure:
![](/Mod2/Images/Week1/FolderWithDifferentFileTypes.png)

We can make changes to, and save each of these files individually. But, it would be useful if we could group certain changes to all files together, so that we could save changes to the **project** as a whole.  For example, if I were a teacher reviewing this student's final project, I would want to know that the student added supporting materials when they added a section specific to Grace Hopper - I would want to see that these changes are related.

**Git** allows for the scenario described above!  Git is a program that allows us to group different files into one project, called a **repository**.  Once we add git to a project, we can make changes to many different files, and save those changes *with one command*. Also, we can add a comment to the project each time we save so we can give more information about _why_ a change was made. 

### Version Control
This process of managing changes on a project as a whole, is called **Version Control**.  Git is a **Version Control System** or VCS - there are multiple VCS programs available, but Git is the most widely used in software development.

At its most basic, a project's version control history might look like this:

In this workflow, we are starting a project, and creating save-points along the way

### Git 
- one VCS option (the most commonly used)
- Create a repository
- Make some commits

### Branching
- why branching?
- diagram branching workflow
- practice branching

### GitHub
- why github?
- push work to github
- explore history on github
