# Version Control with Git/Github

## Learning Goals
- Define Version Control and its benefit
- Build a mental model of branching workflow
- Practice committing and branching on a solo repository

## Warm Up
In a notebook, reflect on the following:
* When doing something like writing an essay, or research paper, how have you saved your work?
* For school projects, what tools have you used to collaborate on a presentation or paper?
* What do you already know about git and GitHub?

### Why Git?
When we work on long projects (something that takes more than a few hours - writing a book, tracking a budget, or coding an application), we need to often:
* save progress
* edit old work
* share our work with others

You may be familiar with doing all of these things with tools like Google Docs, Excel, or Word.  All of these programs allow you to save, edit and share work.  But, they each can only manage their own files - with one command you can only save or share one at a time.

Today, we are going to introduce a new tool for managing how we save, edit, and share our work.

Let's say you have a project on your computer that has the following file structure:
![](/Mod2/Images/Week1/FolderWithDifferentFileTypes.png)

We can make changes to, and save each of these files individually. But, it would be useful if we could group certain changes to all files together, so that we could save changes to the **project** as a whole.  For example, if I were a teacher reviewing this student's final project, I would want to know that the student added supporting materials when they added a section specific to Grace Hopper - I would want to see that these changes are related.

**Git** allows for the scenario described above!  Git is a program that allows us to group different files into one project, called a **repository**.  Once we add git to a project, we can make changes to many different files, and save those changes *with one command*. Also, we can add a comment to the project each time we save so we can give more information about _why_ a change was made. 

### Version Control
This process of managing changes on a project as a whole, is called **Version Control**.  Git is a **Version Control System** or VCS - there are multiple VCS programs available, but Git is the most widely used in software development.

At its most basic, a project's version control history might look like this:

![Single Branch VC Flow](/Mod2/Images/Week1/VCBasic.JPG)

In this workflow, we are starting a project, and creating save-points along the way.  These save-points are called **commits** and each commit is a snapshot of what the project looks like at that moment.  We could go back (revert) to any of these commits to see previous versions of the project.  We can also see a history of the project's progrssion through the messages left in the commits - like `Add User Registration`. In this way, we are creating a more detailed history of the project than just saving files.

### Git 

The best way to learn how to use Git Version Control is to dive right in - so that's what we are going to do!

> Individually, take 20 minutes to follow along with the 3 vidoes below; pause as needed and complete each step outlined.  After completing the steps, you will have completed a git workflow similar to the diagram above.
>1. [Create A Project and Initialize a Git Repository](https://www.loom.com/share/d3af392e059147a699ce6ac1af65d251)
>2. [Add Commits to the Git Repository](https://www.loom.com/share/b7373e5aaad646c790965422719bb993)
>3. [Review the Commit History](https://www.loom.com/share/f419b8568ac348e391eb1c90580d894e)

After you have completed the individual work above:

> In small groups: discuss the process that you just completed.  As a starter, answer the following questions:
> * What is the difference between saving and commiting?
> * How do you know what changes were made in an individual commit?

** Instructor Note ** After letting groups discuss their challenges and questions, do a walkthrough of the process, answering questions as you go.

### Branching
- why branching?
- diagram branching workflow
- practice branching

One of the benefits of using Git, is the ability to create **branches**.  A branch is a separate workspace where you can create new features, or work on fixing bugs, without altering your main project.

Developers often have strict rules about when changes to a project can be made directly onto the `main` branch.  The `main` branch is typically reserved for production-ready code; `main` should always be ready to show to a client or stakeholder without fear of major bugs.  This means that new features are developed on tier own branches, and then **merged** into the main branch.

When we create a new branch to work on a new feature, we call this **checking out a branch**.  We checkout a branch by creating a copy of `main` - that way our new feature is built with our current functionality as its base.

Check out this visual representation of branching:

Here, we have a project that is created, then two branches are formed to work on different features.  Once each feature is complete, it is merged into the `main` branch.  There may be many commits on each branch, and each of those commits will be represented in the commit history of the `main` branch when the feature branch is merged!

> Individually, we are going to continue to practice working with git and branching by following along with the following 3 videos.  As before, pause the videos as necessary, and complete all steps demonstrated.  When finished, you will have created two branches, and merged those branches back to `main`.
>1. [Creating Branches](https://www.loom.com/share/d675a00c7c634d35b977a7df6972b13c)
>2. [Merging Branches](https://www.loom.com/share/d12d3d510da9402092fe793b4a398bd1)
>3. [Merged Commit History](https://www.loom.com/share/e5baba208ec441a6a157a8b956dc30f9)

After you have completed the individual work above:

> In small groups: discuss the process that you just completed.  As a starter, answer the following questions:
> * What is the purpose of branching?
> * When we merge branches together, why might they not appear in chronological order in the commit history?
> * What causes a merge conflict?

** Instructor Note ** After letting groups discuss their challenges and questions, do a walkthrough of the process, answering questions as you go.

### GitHub
So far, we have created a project with a git repository that exists _only_ on our local machines.  This is fine for some personal projects, but most of the time, you are going to want to share your code.  When you share your code, you can get feedback and help a lot more easily.  Also, sharing your code allows for easier collaboration!

**Github** is where we will share our git repositories.  You have used Github to fork and clone existing repositories - now let's create a Github repository of your own.  When this repository is created, you will have two versions of your project:
* **local** repository that lives only on your computer
* **remote** repository that lives in the cloud - it can be cloned by anyone on Github.

> Individually, watch the video below to create a GitHub Repository for your Git Practice project.
> [Creating and Pushing to a Github Repository](https://www.loom.com/share/dba188a5f13e43059d9a84b630280c53)

After you have completed the individual work above:

> In small groups: discuss the process that you just completed.  As a starter, answer the following questions:
> * When you pushed to Github, did all of your branches get pushed?
> * Will you only push a project to Github once?

** Instructor Note ** After their discussion, we want to re-inforce that the work they do locally will not appear on github until they push that work up.  There is no 'open channel' between the two repositories.

### A Quick Note!
In this lesson, we have covered a lot - and we have only scratched the surface of Git and version control processes.  As a developer you will continue to practice and improve these skills, so don't be discouraged if your first few tries with git don't go as planned!  There are very few Git experts in the world, and it is not something you must _master_ in order to be a great developer.  But, you do need to practice git, and ask questions when you get stuck ðŸ™‚.
